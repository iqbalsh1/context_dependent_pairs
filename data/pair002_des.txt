Information for pairs02:

Jena Climate Dataset (Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry) data was recorded at the Weather Station at Jena, Germany

taken from
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/jena-climate/data

original data source:
https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/

x: wind direction (wd (deg))

y: wind speed (wv (m/s))

Note: Data pair contains some missing values (wv (m/s) = -9999) that have been removed before visualization.
The scatter plot therefore only includes valid wind velocity data.

ground truth:
x â†’ y
