Time Dependent Pair09 Description

This dataset contains 350 samples with a temperature-dependent causal relationship between variables X and Y.
The variable "Temperature" is uniformly sampled between -7 and 25 degrees.

Causal threshold: Temperature = 10°C

Segment 1 (T < 10):
    Causal Direction: X → Y
    Generation:
        X ~ Normal(0, 1)
        Y = 1.0 * X + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0, 0.7)

Segment 2 (T ≥ 10):
    Causal Direction: Y → X
    Generation:
        Y ~ Normal(0, 1)
        X = -1.5 * Y + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0, 0.7)

All values include Gaussian noise to simulate realistic measurement variations.
The dataset does not include the regime label but causal influence shifts at the temperature threshold.
