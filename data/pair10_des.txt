Time Dependent Pair10 Description

This dataset contains 500 samples with a temperature-dependent causal relationship between variables X and Y.
The variable "Temperature" is uniformly sampled between -10 and 22 degrees.

Causal threshold: Temperature = 12°C

Segment 1 (T < 12):
    Causal Direction: X → Y
    Generation:
        X ~ Normal(0, 1)
        Y = 0.9 * X + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0, 0.9)

Segment 2 (T ≥ 12):
    Causal Direction: Y → X
    Generation:
        Y ~ Normal(0, 1)
        X = -0.8 * Y + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0, 0.9)

All values include Gaussian noise to simulate realistic measurement variations.
The dataset does not include the regime label but causal influence shifts at the temperature threshold.
