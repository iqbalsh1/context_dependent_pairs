Time Dependent Pair10 Description

This dataset contains 1000 samples with a temperature-dependent causal relationship between variables X and Y.
The variable "Temperature" is uniformly sampled between -10 and 30 degrees.

Causal threshold: Temperature = 15°C

Segment 1 (T < 15):
    Causal Direction: X → Y
    Generation:
        X ~ Mixture of Normal(-8, 1.5) and Normal(12, 3.0)
        Y = 1.8 * X + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0, 1.5)

Segment 2 (T ≥ 15):
    Causal Direction: Y → X
    Generation:
        Y ~ Mixture of Normal(-8, 1.5) and Normal(12, 3.0)
        X = -2.2 * Y + ε, where ε ~ Normal(0, 1.5)

All values include Gaussian noise to simulate realistic measurement variations.
The dataset does not include the regime label but causal influence shifts at the temperature threshold.

Random seed: 42 (for reproducibility)
