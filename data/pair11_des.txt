Time Dependent Pair08 Description

This dataset contains 1000 samples with a non-linear temperature-dependent causal relationship between variables X and Y.
The variable "Temperature" is uniformly sampled between -10 and 30 degrees.

Causal threshold: Temperature = 15°C

Segment 1 (T < 15):
    Causal Direction: X → Y
    Generation:
        X ~ Uniform(-5, 5)
        Y = 2.0 * X^2 + ε, where ε ~ Gaussian(0, 1.0)

Segment 2 (T ≥ 15):
    Causal Direction: Y → X
    Generation:
        Y ~ Uniform(-5, 5)
        X = -1.5 * sin(Y) + ε, where ε ~ Laplace(0, 1.0)

All values include mixed noise types (Gaussian and Laplace) to simulate realistic measurement variations.
The dataset does not include the regime label but causal influence shifts at the temperature threshold.
